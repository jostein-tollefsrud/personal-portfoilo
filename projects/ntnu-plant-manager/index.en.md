## Process

After clarifying with the project owner what the wishes and needs were, we started sketching before we made the hifi prototype in Figma. Once the design was approved, we started developing the site using the MERN stack.

## Method

Research was done to uncover the needs of the project. User testing of prototype and coded application, as well as testing of universal design.

## Result

The result was a full-stack app where the project owner could manage all the plants at NTNU.
