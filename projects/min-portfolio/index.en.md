## Process

It started with me making a simple prototype in Figma before I made the final version during the actual development. It was created with Next.js as a static page for fast loading of the web page.

## Method

I researched a lot of portfolios to find out what I wanted to include. The website has been tested for functionality and universal design.

## Result

The result was a portfolio where I can showcase the best projects I have, and tell a little more about myself as a developer.
