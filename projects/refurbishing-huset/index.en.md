## Process

We were given a finished prototype where we discovered major shortcomings that led us to completely redesign the site. We then developed the website with the wishes and needs of the project owner.

## Method

We created personas based on interviews with the project owner, user surveys and card sorting, which became scenarios we took as our starting point during the design phase, which was again user-tested. Throughout the period we met the project owner to discuss wishes and needs.

## Result

The result was a full-stack website with a CMS system that met the requirements of the project owner.
